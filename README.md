ACI_shop - Automated control information for Shop
-------------------------------------------
  The information system was created on the topics of the course project on the discipline OOP. 

  Relevance of the topic lies in the fact that most of the stores are moving to self-service booths and, I believe, that in this area for a long time this issue will be relevant. The software (SW), which was developed by me, is to improve the efficiency of employees through a friendly interface and rapid response to tasks. The program itself provides for separation of interfaces: the user can only place orders, but the administrator has immediate access to the invoice file itself and has all rights to view, edit and delete the data.
  
  The purpose of the program is to accelerate and automate the purchasing process in the store, making it easier to work and increasing the efficiency of the staff, That is why the idea was taken from the system of order registration in large supermarkets, where part of the cash register can be used by both the customer and the cashier, because the interface has all the indicators for convenient operation.
  
  The integrity of the data in the program itself provides several files with different data, for ease of further processing of information, so there is a file that stores all the receipts, the file which contains information about the goods that are present in the warehouse, Access to this file from the program has only the administrator, there is also a file that stores data about the administrator (login and password), so in the file of the program before the first launch it is necessary to make a name, login and password, so that the program could authorize the administrator.

  The interface is designed with an emphasis on possible mistakes of the user, so there is a note to confirm the actions, or return, by hierarchy, to the previous menu item. Also, attention is paid to the processing of the entered data to ensure trouble-free operation of the software.
